[K8s][Cert]
Understanding how the cert is categorised helps to choose and understand more the practical exercises.

Insight:
Goal of k8s: desired state management
Big technical components could be generally grouped into: Cluster/ Node, Pods/Service/Jobs

3 types of interaction with required for this k8s job:
Imperative: probably just ssh to VPS, and interact thru cmd.
Declarative: yaml. For big very tiny specific configuration
Via web dashboard: probably for inspecting and troubleshooting

Interesting thing to know:
Plugged in type architecture which means k8s is growing everyday. “There is a full time job just to see what’s new on K8s  everyday” According to Joe Beda lol.
