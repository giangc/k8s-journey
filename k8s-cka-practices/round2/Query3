# NETWORKING
* Track of used networking devices:
 - switching
 - router
 - router gateway
 - DNS: hosts table: /etc/hosts

1. Connect to a private network via switching
- ip link
- ip addr add 192.168.1.10/24 dev etho0
- ip addr add 192.168.2.10/24 dev etho0

2. Connect 2 private neworks of switching via router
- route
- ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1# route gateway

3. Establish a network which contains
- 3 computers ABC: B is a router
- A -> B via Switch AB, B -> C via Switch BC
such that:
 A will be able to receives info from C
  * route # check routing table
  * route the C switching address to B gateway of A
  * change the value of ipforward from 0 to 1 
  * cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward 
  * echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward 
  * change content on /etc/systctl.conf : ip_forward = 1

 C will be able to receives info from A
  * route # check routing table
  * # route the A switching address to B gateway of C

4. Connect router(private network) to internet network
 - ip route add 0.0.0.0 via 192.168.2.1
 - ip route add default via 192.168.2.1

5. DNS
General stuff
 * 192.168.1.2 db
 * ping db
 - namespace 
 - namespace process
 - nslookup
 - dig
 - CNAME: name to name mapping
 Change host name mapping table
   - /etc/resolv.conf  # for nameserver
   - /etc/hosts

Setup DNS Server using CoreDNS

netstat -nplt
netstat -anp | grep etcd	
ip link 
ip route show default
ip link show ens3

Correct! That's because 2379 is the port of ETCD 
to which all control plane components connect
 to. 2380 is only for etcd peer-to-peer
  connectivity. When you have multiple 
	master nodes. In this case we don't.

CNI
- cni config dir
- cni bin dir
ls /etc/cni/net.d/
ls /opt/cni/bin
ps -aux | grep kubelet
cat /etc/cni/net.d/10-weave.conf
What binary executable file will be run
 by kubelet after a container 
 and its associated namespace are created.
 --> "type": "weave-net"

6: weave: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1376 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether ce:13:79:1a:ed:6c brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

Q: What is the POD IP address range configured by weave?
A: Run the command 'ip addr show weave'
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --restart=Never --dry-run -o yaml > pod.yaml

Q: What is the range of IP addresses configured for PODs on this cluster?
A: kubectl logs weave-net-jl4s4 weave -n kube-system

Q: What is the IP Range configured for the services within the cluster?
A: ps -aux | grep kube-api --> --service-cluster-ip-range=10.96.0.0/12

Q: What is the responsibility for kube-proxy? 
A: Everytime a service is created,
 kubeproxy create forwarding rules for each service

Q: What type of proxy is the kube-proxy configured to use?
A: kubectl logs kube-proxy-bff4z -n kube-system
