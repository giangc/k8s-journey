Round 1 is a series of any possible practices, that I found on official K8s document to learn about the concept of Kubernetes, based on the Certified Kubernetes Administrator certificate content(CKA). So that the knowledge I learnt from the whole process is based on CKA content. 

I started out learning about k8s after I finished learning about basic Docker concepts. But k8s ecosystem, and k8s doc is a different thing to learn from like Docker. After a while I had learnt k8s concept on its document, I was struggled to find practices/practical knowledge to learn about some K8s concepts, that are well-rounded enough, for me to form as a practice. Which means, most of the k8s Concepts are quite complex for me. It sometimes mixes with lots of other concepts, e.g: Networking, Security, which I think take times to learn and consolidate as a whole. For me as a new learner, as well as started digging more advance on infrastructure topics, it's quite a challenge. 

Before taking the 1st attempt on CKA, I've spent 2 weeks on udemy course(aka CKA course from KodeCloud). I found it is extremely useful to understand the basic concepts + practical labs help forming my mental model when I work on any k8s concepts. 

After reviewing everything, I see my opportunity to replan my practical process as in `round2` directory. I may try to explain how ...
