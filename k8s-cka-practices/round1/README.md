Round 1 is a series of any possible practices, that I found on official K8s document to learn about the concept of Kubernetes, based on the Certified Kubernetes Administrator certificate content(CKA). So that the knowledge I learnt from the whole process is based on CKA content. Therefore everytime I mentioned about the learning concepts, I was talking about the my learning on CKA concepts.

To sum up the experience, I have struggled to find practices/practical knowledge to learn about some K8s concepts, that are well-rounded enough, for me to form as a practice. It sometimes mixes with lots of other concepts, e.g: Networking, Security, which I think take times to learn and consolidate as a whole. For me as a new learner, as well as started digging more advance on infrastructure topics, it's quite a challenge. As I reviewed multiple times on the CKA contents, I decided to take round2 practices, which I hope would yeild a better result of practices.
