[K8s-101] Simple network communication. NetworkPolicy in simplicity

1. Networking communication, ingress/ergress.

Normal internet application architecture includes following components:
 - User client
 - Web UI
 - Server backend
 - DB
 
 Those components requires to be connected. The connection would be: 
 - User Client --> Web UI --> Server backend --> DB
 - User Client <-- Web UI <-- Server backend <-- DB

 Above illustration could be deduced into: incoming/outcomming traffic, equivalent to ingress/ergress

2. Needs for policy
 - We don't want Web UI connect to DB directly, in vice versa. We need restriction We know that as
  the web grows, the restriction is growing with the web. We use NetworkPolicy to create such restriction in k8s
