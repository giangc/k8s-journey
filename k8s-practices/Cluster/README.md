 ## Mental Note 

- We have 2 approaches in setting up ha Cluster with stacked control plane or with external ectd Cluster.
- Requirement for HA Clusters is generally 3 nodes for masters, and 3 nodes for workers.
- Steps include:
    - Setup Load Balancer type for etcd cluster
    - 

----- 

- What is this using for? 

 ## Practical Note

I need to be more objective - extremely objective from now on ... 
 (1) What I possibly know how to do
 (2) What requires to much time to learn or understand in details, which I also struggled to do

- Practice (1) make sure it's good
- (2) 
 - Recognise it
 - Allocate time to write down what I think it should work(because like Cluster I really don't have time to practice all of it)
