# KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT_HTTPS=443
# Note thereâ€™s no mention of your Service.
#  This is because you created the replicas before the Service.
# Another disadvantage of doing this is that the scheduler might put both Pods
# on the same machine, which will take your entire Service down if it dies.
# We can do this the right way by killing the 2 Pods and waiting for the Deployment 
#to recreate them. This time around the Service exists before the replicas. 
#This will give you scheduler-level Service spreading of your Pods 
#(provided all your nodes have equal capacity),
# as well as the right environment variables:
